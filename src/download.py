def handle_download(event, context):
    """
    Receives a request to retrieve model assets and metadata, assembles the
    necessary information from RDS and S3, and returns it to the caller.
    """

    # 1. Parse request context ------------------------------------------------
    #    - Extract `model_id`, desired artifact types, and any caller metadata
    #      (e.g., IAM principal, requested format) from the event payload.
    #    - Validate that the requestor is authorised; if not, return 403.

    # 2. Prepare AWS clients and config ---------------------------------------
    #    - Create boto3 clients for RDS access (via a connection pool) and S3.
    #    - Load bucket/table names and optional caching layer configuration
    #      from environment variables or Secrets Manager.

    # 3. Fetch model record from RDS ------------------------------------------
    #    - Query the `model_registry` table with `model_id`.
    #    - If the model is missing, return a 404 response to the router.
    #    - Collect fields such as artifact S3 keys, metadata JSON, and any
    #      CloudWatch log references needed for auditing.

    # 4. Retrieve artifacts from S3 -------------------------------------------
    #    - For each S3 key listed in the model record:
    #        * Option A: Generate presigned download URLs and include them in
    #          the response for clients to fetch directly.
    #        * Option B: Stream the object into a temporary buffer if the
    #          router expects the Lambda to return the bytes inline.
    #    - Handle large artifact cases by using range requests or multipart
    #      downloads when necessary.

    # 5. Assemble response payload --------------------------------------------
    #    - Combine RDS metadata (likes, downloads, datasets) with the S3 access
    #      details gathered above.
    #    - Include diagnostic information (timestamps, request ID) for logging.

    # 6. Emit telemetry -------------------------------------------------------
    #    - Record success/failure to CloudWatch and increment usage metrics.
    #    - Optionally publish an access event to an audit trail (e.g., Kinesis).

    # 7. Return data to caller ------------------------------------------------
    #    - Structure the Lambda response in API Gateway format
    #      (`statusCode`, `headers`, `body`) or the contract defined by the
    #      routing Lambda.

    # Placeholder return until concrete implementation is added.
    return {
        "statusCode": 501,
        "body": "Download handler not yet implemented",
    }
