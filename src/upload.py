def handle_upload(event, context):
    """
    Accepts an event from the routing Lambda/API Gateway and orchestrates the
    process of validating metadata, pushing model artifacts to storage, and
    recording the entry in the RDS catalog.
    """

    # 1. Parse the inbound request -------------------------------------------
    #    - Read fields such as `model_id`, source repository URLs, and any
    #      presigned upload URLs supplied by upstream services.
    #    - Validate the payload structure; if required fields are missing,
    #      raise a 4xx-style error back to the router.

    # 2. Establish AWS clients and shared dependencies ------------------------
    #    - Instantiate boto3 clients for RDS (through an ORM/DB driver) and S3.
    #    - Load configuration (DB credentials, bucket names) from environment
    #      variables or AWS Secrets Manager.
    #    - Initialise structured logging/metrics helpers for CloudWatch.

    # 3. Check for existing model entry ---------------------------------------
    #    - Query the RDS `model_registry` table with the provided `model_id`.
    #    - If a row already exists, decide whether to skip, soft-update, or
    #      return a conflict response, depending on business rules.
    #    - If the model is new, continue with the upload workflow.

    # 4. Gather or compute metadata needed for storage ------------------------
    #    - Call external APIs (e.g., Hugging Face) to enrich the record with
    #      likes, downloads, license info, and dataset references.
    #    - Collect rating inputs; if required metrics are missing, call the
    #      `rate` Lambda/workflow and wait for its response.

    # 5. Upload model artifacts to S3 -----------------------------------------
    #    - Determine the S3 key prefix for this model (`models/{model_id}/...`).
    #    - For each artifact in the payload, stream the bytes to S3 or move
    #      them from a temporary location referenced by a presigned URL.
    #    - Verify integrity (checksums) and capture object version IDs.

    # 6. Record entry in the RDS catalog --------------------------------------
    #    - Construct the insert/update statement with metadata (size, dataset
    #      linkage, CloudWatch log pointers, S3 object keys, timestamp).
    #    - Execute within a transaction and commit so downstream services can
    #      immediately discover the new model.

    # 7. Emit telemetry and build response ------------------------------------
    #    - Log success/failure details to CloudWatch, including latency and
    #      size metrics.
    #    - Publish any required SNS/SQS notifications for the rating pipeline.
    #    - Return a JSON payload to the routing Lambda, containing the newly
    #      created database record ID and S3 locations.

    # Placeholder return until concrete implementation is added.
    return {"statusCode": 501, "body": "Upload handler not yet implemented"}
